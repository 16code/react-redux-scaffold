# Readme 

This project is based on [generator-react-webpack](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack), great thank to it!

Hope it could help you build client-side app swiftly.

`gulp serve` to start a hot reload server

`gulp build:dist` to build production code!

## Feature

- ES6+ support
- Redux included (also devtools)
- react-router included
- Hot reload
- webpack based
- All package **latest**!

## Tips

- .raw.css would help you if you want REALLY RAW css
- run both webpack dev server && mock server(/src/server.js)
- fill your mock data in /src/mock!
